    "Training Set:\n",
    "Purpose: The training set is used to train the machine learning model. It contains a large portion of the available data and is used to teach the model to make predictions or learn patterns from the data.\n",

    "Validation Set:\n",
    "Purpose: The validation set is used to fine-tune the model during training. It is a separate subset of data that the model does not see during training but is used to assess the model's performance and make adjustments (e.g., hyperparameter tuning).\n",
    "Importance: The validation set helps to monitor the model's performance and generalization. By evaluating the model on the validation set, you can detect issues like overfitting (when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data) and make necessary adjustments to improve its generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing Set:\n",
    "Purpose: The testing set is used to assess the final performance and generalization of the model. It should be entirely independent of the data used for training and validation.\n",
    "Importance: The testing set serves as a benchmark for the model's overall performance. It gives you a realistic estimate of how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios. It helps ensure that the model's performance is not over-optimistic due to overfitting to the validation set."
